Likes Button Plan -

Goal: create a button for each resource item that when pressed updates the number of upvotes
To do this I need to:

- add a button to each resourceItem (done)
- ~~change state in app so that it accepts an upvotes option~~
  - doesn't need to be done given states set up
- connect that button to state

- given that the state is fetched from the backend on load I will need to edit the backend to accept a likes column.

Questions

- should this be its own component
- to what extent should I just rely on libraries for this sort of thing
